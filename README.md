# Deep Bike

This project is the result of the collaboration between CÃ´me, Charles, Fabien, Josselin and Joachim for the Ecole Polytechnique AI Hackathon (April 10 - 11, 2021).

## Description
The project involves various studies around bike networks worldwide and their security:
1. Smart Bike Network Optimization: Our data-driven approach, using k-means clustering, redefines bike stations for maximum efficiency and enjoyment.

2. Connected Biking Experience: Social networking principles integrate biking into your lifestyle, fostering community, sharing routes, and enhancing your journey.

3. Cutting-Edge Security: Utilizing deep learning, we predict bike availability, while our advanced security measures detect users, extract facial data, and ensure helmet compliance for a safe ride.
